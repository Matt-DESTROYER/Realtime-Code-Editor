# Realtime Web Editor
An editor that has HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality with a realtime preview (can be turned on/off) and the ability to download your code once finished.

# Save
When you feel satisfied with your code and wish to save it you can simply click the save button and it will be compiled into a file named `index.html` which will be saved in your downloads folder. (Note that the file will be saved as one line so you may wish to use a validator/pretty printer to make the code readable.)

# Realtime
Everytime a change is made to any of the textareas the preview is updated. This enables you to preview your code in realtime. (This feature can be turned off.)

# HTML, CSS and JavaScript
The editor contains a textarea for each of these languages to customise your webpage however you choose.

# Preview
On the left side of the page is a preview area. All your code will be displayed their so you can test your code, debug your code e.t.c. Every change you make will reset the realtime preview unless realtime preview is turned off.
